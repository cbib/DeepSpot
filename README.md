# DeepSpot

**DeepSpot** is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) dedicated to the enhancement of fluorescent spots in microscopy images,
enabling downstream mRNA spot detection using commonly used tools without need for parameter fine-tuning.
 **DeepSpot** is based on a multi-network architecture, using Atrou convolution (A) for context reasonning and a twisted ResNet 
architecture (B) to automatically enhance the mRNA spots in images.
